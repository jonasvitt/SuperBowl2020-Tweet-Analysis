# SuperBowl2020-Ad-Analysis
*Text analysis Tweets related to the ads during SuperBowl 2020*

This code was created as part of the Game Day Analytics Challenge hosted by the Informations Systems Department at the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah.

In this competition, students applyed business analytics skills and gain practical knowledge, including data collection, data processing and cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. We got a data set with tweets of the top keywords mentioned in all the ads. The task was then to gather insights out of the data set and create an infographic and a white paper.

I was focused on the text analysis which is collected here. We focused on the text analysis of the tweets connected to the brands Tide, Jeep, and Google.


## Some of our main findings:
First, we found that a high tweet volume following a tweet, does not equal an overall successful ad. Second, we found no correlation between the amount spent on an ad (based on the average price for a 30-second commercial during the 2020 Super Bowl) and the number of generated tweets. And lastly, one of our main findings was that comedy is a critical success factor for a Super Bowl ad.
